BookHub

“Your Digital Bookshelf”

ABSTRACT

The “BookHub” is an Online Book Store project inspired by a passion for reading and the desire to make books more accessible to everyone. This project aims to create a comprehensive platform that caters to book lovers and individuals who are constrained by the cost of books. BookHub will facilitate users' buying, selling, and even donating both new and used books, making literature more accessible and affordable for everyone.
Key functionalities of the platform include secure user registration and authentication, allowing for distinct roles such as buyers and sellers. Each user will have a personal dashboard dedicated to them. Sellers can list both new and used books with essential details of the book, images, and pricing, while buyers or users can make purchases and donate books for free. Advanced search and filtering options will help users easily find books based on categories, conditions, and prices. Additionally, the platform will feature a user-friendly shopping cart, a secure checkout process, and a book review system where users can share their thoughts on books they have read. An admin dashboard will enable efficient management of users, book listings, and site content.
The development of the website will be carried out using PHP for server-side scripting and MySQL for database management, with the front-end design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface. Overall, this project aims to bridge the gap between the high cost of new books and the need for affordable reading material, creating a community of engaged readers through the review system, and promoting literacy by making books accessible to a wider audience.
