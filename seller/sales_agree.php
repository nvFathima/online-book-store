    <p>
        I understand that the final decision upon whether the book should be accepted or rejected is solely determined by the BookHub admin.
        The book may get rejected if any violation to the terms and conditions for book listings is found.
    </p>
    <p>
        I also acknowledge that submitting a book listing does not guarantee its acceptance, and I must follow the siteâ€™s policies regarding the accuracy of information, copyright issues, and any other relevant criteria for listing books.
